## About The Project

Imagine not having to stare at your computer for 12 hours a day just to press the A and D keys. Imagine, being able to skip all the repetitive processes of farming and do other things simultaneously. Farm Helper is a highly customizable skyblock quality of life (QOL) mod that automates boring farming processes, freeing up your time for other activities.

Revolutionizing the farming meta of Hypixel skyblock, Farm Helper has already been downloaded over 30,000 times. Start your QOL journey by joining the MoonRocks community!
